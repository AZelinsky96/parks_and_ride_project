# Welcome to Parks and Ride Project


## Description:
    This is a multipart application that deals with engineering the data, as well as serving the data
    to consumer in the form of a mapped dashboard. The data is sourced via a series of lambda function
    triggered by s3 upload events. You can find design diagrams located within the design and flows 
    folder. When a supported file (i.e. csv) is uploaded to the s3 bucket, this triggers a lambda 
    function to read and process the file into an uniform format. This formatted data is uploaded back 
    to an s3 bucket which in turns triggers another function to build the data models and upload 
    the data to an RDS database. 

    Once the data is uploaded to the database, it is instantly available to the consumer facing 
    dashboard. The dashboard will ping the database every 15 minutes to search for more data to be 
    added to the display. The display is built out as a series of markers overlayed on a roadmap. The 
    markers are positioned according to their latitude and longitude. The markers are color coded from 
    red to green according to the number of spaces available. A marker is colored red if there are few 
    spaces, colored yellow if there is a moderate amount of spaces, and colored green if there are plenty 
    of spaces. If you hover over each individual marker, you will find information pertaining to each 
    unique mark. 


## Prerequisites:
    To make use of this application and run it on your local you will need the following: 
    1. A mapbox token.
    2. A connection_details.py file: This file contains a dictionary of connection details to be utilized 
    by the sqlalchemy orm when initializing an engine object
    
    The application is packaged via poetry to be run on a local environment. Follow the steps below to 
    configure the env.

    1. Install poetry
    2. Within the project directory on same level as .toml file run: poetry install
    3. When trying to run the application run: poetry run python<version> application.py

## How to run Tests:

    Make sure that you followed the steps above to install poetry and intialise the environment. 
    To run the tests, run the run_test.sh shell script via bash.

TODO: Find better deployment methods for lambda functions. (Docker?? Ansible??)

TODO: Expand data_access_layer to include more data sources(json, xml, excel, etc.)
